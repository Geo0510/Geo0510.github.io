## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Basic HTML and CSS knowledge it is very important because thanks to that many problems in this area can be solve really easy. A lot I learned over this month and i know, a long and stressful path is coming but I 'm ready for it.

```html
<main><section class="container"></section></main>
```

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
}
.container {
  width: 300px;
  margin: 5em auto 5em auto;
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  text-align: center;
  padding: 15px;
  border-radius: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

I have a simple goal, be a well-trained front-end developer. But to be able to that I need to practice more with CSS, HTML and JAVASCRIPT. 
All I want right now it's to learn the very basics of these web tecnologies. I said early it's going to be difficult at the beginning I know for that reason I'm prepraring as much as I can.

### Useful resources

- [A Tale of `width` and `max-width`](https://css-tricks.com/tale-width-max-width/) - This helped me to understand more of width and max-width. it's really interesting how both work together.
